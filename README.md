# Memento

## Add sub project to your main project
In case of new project create directory for it:
```
mkdir memento
cd memento
git init
```
or clone it from existing repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jarekkozak/memento.git
cd memento
```

Add location of your project:
```
git remote add memento-a https://github.com/jarekkozak/memento-a.git
```

Add *"memento-a"* as you subproject
```
git subtree add â€”-prefix=memento-a memento-a master
```

Please notice --prefix option is obligatory, points subdirectowy in which sub-project will be saved.

Let's make a change in parent
```
touch memento-a/fileParent
```
In *"memento-a"* directory *"fileParent"* file has been created

next, commit it to the *"parent"*
```
git add .
git commit -m"File created in parent"
git push origing
```

or 
```
git commit -a -m"File created in parent"
git push origing
```

notice that file has been created only in parent project and pushed to parent remote. Just created file is not pushed to the *"memento-a"* project.

To push changes into *memento-a* use command
```
git subtree push --prefix=memento-a memento-a master
```

if you do changes in *"memento-a"* project (I assume that changes have been commited & pushed) you can update your parent project subtree
```
git subtree pull --prefix=memento-a memento-a master --squash
git commit -a
git push origin
```
